## üìò Abstract

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis pipeline, emphasizing **preprocessing**, **EDA**, and **visualizations** to derive insights from motorsport data. Key stages include:
- Integration with Google Drive (for dataset access).
- Use of Python libraries for summarization and plotting.
- Structured data duplication to ensure raw integrity.
- Automated insights via reusable functions (`get_desired_summary`).
- Use of waterfall charts and custom visuals to highlight performance shifts.

This systemized approach ensures clean datasets ready for ML or advanced analytics, with a focus on reproducibility and future adaptability.

## ü§ñ Models Implemented

In addition to exploratory data analysis, several machine learning models were deployed to uncover predictive patterns and support strategic decisions. Below is a breakdown of each model's purpose, rationale, outcomes, and analytical contribution:

---

### üéØ RandomForestClassifier  
![Figure 38](./assets/figure38_randomforest.png.jpg)

**Purpose**:  
To classify whether an incident occurred during a race (e.g., retirement, crash) or predict race winners based on performance and status metrics.

**Why It Was Used**:  
Random Forest is a powerful ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees. It performs well on **non-linear** data and handles **imbalanced features** and **missing values** better than most single estimators. Its feature importance metric also aids in interpretability.

**Results Achieved**:  
- Achieved **91.77% accuracy** for incident prediction.
- ~80% accuracy for race winner classification (though precision/recall imbalance existed due to fewer positive class samples).

**Analytical Benefit**:  
Helped assess race outcome reliability based on pit data and status flags. Highlighted critical features influencing retirements, which can inform future safety or strategy improvements.

---

### üìâ Support Vector Regressor (SVR)  
![Figure 39](./assets/figure39_svr.png.jpg)

**Purpose**:  
To estimate driver lap times based on circuit attributes and historical race metrics.

**Why It Was Used**:  
SVR is ideal for **capturing non-linear relationships** using kernel functions. It's particularly suited for **high-dimensional, continuous data**, making it a good candidate for time-related predictions.

**Results Achieved**:  
- Performance was **suboptimal**, with high **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **negative R¬≤ scores**.

**Analytical Limitation**:  
The model exposed **data quality issues** and potential underfitting. This was useful in identifying the need for better feature engineering and data normalization before modeling.

---

### üî¢ Ridge Regression  
![Figure 40](./assets/figure40_ridge.png.jpg)

**Purpose**:  
To predict race outcomes (finishing positions) based on variables such as pit stop duration, qualifying position, and constructor.

**Why It Was Used**:  
Ridge Regression incorporates **L2 regularization**, making it robust against **multicollinearity**. It's preferred when trying to retain all features while reducing overfitting in linear models.

**Results Achieved**:  
- Results showed **high MSE** and **low R¬≤**, indicating that linear assumptions didn‚Äôt hold for the chosen feature set.

**Analytical Insight**:  
Though not optimal, the model reinforced the complexity of race outcome prediction and the need for more non-linear approaches or richer features.

---

### üå≥ DecisionTreeRegressor  
![Figure 41](./assets/figure41_decisiontree.png.jpg)

**Purpose**:  
To predict qualifying grid positions using driver and circuit data.

**Why It Was Used**:  
Decision Trees provide **fast, interpretable**, and **non-linear predictions**. They don't require feature scaling and are robust to outliers and missing data.

**Results Achieved**:  
- Delivered reasonable position predictions with limited tuning.
- Exact metrics (R¬≤, MSE) were not deeply evaluated but qualitatively aligned with actual results.

**Analytical Benefit**:  
Served as a simple benchmark model for more advanced regressors and offered insight into how key features like circuit type, historical rank, or constructor affect grid placement.

---

### üìä Strategy Simulation (Non-ML)

**Purpose**:  
Simulated different pit stop strategies to evaluate their impact on total race time.

**Why It Was Used**:  
When machine learning isn't feasible (e.g., lack of labeled data), simulations help **compare hypothetical scenarios** using statistical averages and variances.

**Results Achieved**:  
- Quantified effects of 1-stop vs 2-stop vs 3-stop strategies.
- Helped teams balance tire degradation vs pit stop delay.

**Analytical Value**:  
Offered tangible time-saving estimates for strategy planning, aiding constructors in pre-race decision-making.
